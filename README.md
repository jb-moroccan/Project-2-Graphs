CS 435 Project 2 Graphs

Each file is named to match the section in the project. I completed the extra credit portions within the dijkstra's and a* sections. Also, you should be able to just run the files as is without anything extra. I have test cases too that you can modify to your liking :) 

*Note: to run the portion with 10000 nodes for the edgextra credit, you should upload the file to the OSL computers on AFS. my computer and repl.it couldn't handle the 99,990,000 edges, so it's likely it'll die with yours too unless you have a super computer*

*Note for TAs: Sresht said I get extra credit for helping him out and told me to post on my repository to let you all know*
